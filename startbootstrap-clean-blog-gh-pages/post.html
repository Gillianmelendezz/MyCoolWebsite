                  <p>I have stories to tell, people to meet, and places to see. I cannot wait to see what awaits me beyond Gonzaga.</p>
                        <p>From coding robots to writing news articles, my interests go beyond the horizon in discovering what path I should take in life. </p>
                        <p>I love having fun. I love beach trips. I love eating. I love this amazingly confusing earth we call home. </p>
                        <p>Being half Italian half Mexican has its perks, as I get to share amazing food and great experiences from both sides of the world. Family means everything to me. </p>
                        <p>Friendships are the way to a good life. I have memories that I will never forget from having hometown friends to meeting new people from all over the world at Gonzaga.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Who I Am</h2>
                        <p>I am learning every day Who I am and who I want to be. My family has shaped me into becoming a strong and independent woman. I love putting in the effort to see a beautiful outcome.</p>
                        <p>Working in the restaurant business has taught me that patience and guidance are very important. I know how to communicate with all types of different people which sets me aside from others. You will never see me without a smile on my face. (Maybe if I'm hungry, then the smile will be not as big!)</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote"> Every day may not be a great day, but every bad day will make you love and appreciate the good ones.</blockquote>
                        <p>Being a part of a competitive robotics team has made me who I am today. Traveling globally and placing top 16 out of 80 teams has made me strong. Winning first place is something I will never forget, and I have to thank my amazing robotics coach, Sheri Gundlach who is someone I look up to. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why I do what I do</h2>
                        <p>I just want to have the best life and make every day mean something. Something I have learned while being at GU is time is fast... and does not slow down. I want to make the most out of every day. </p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">My campus is important to me. Spokane looks different than California, but I was meant to leave home to find my independence.</span>
                        <p>Beach trips, to Disneyland, to amazing meals and memories made, growing up has been a life of its own thanks to my family. I have been given the tools I need to fly and make a life of my own, as I will never forget where I came from, and the lessons I have learned.</p>
                        <p>I am Gillian Melendez, a writer, food-lover, and a ready-to-see-the-world girl. I'm coming, so please, look out. </p>
                        <p>
                            A special story that means the world to me.
